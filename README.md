# Uno

## About This Project
Jump into a quick-paced game of Uno right from your terminal! This online Uno clone was crafted as a spirited 2-day coding challenge during the CodeForAll Fullstack bootcamp. The project served as a practical exercise in multi-threaded programming, server management, socket communication, and networking. Ready to challenge your friends and maybe lose a few? Jump in and scream UNO!

## How to Play
Get your game on in just a few easy steps:

### Start the Server:
Fire up the server by running the Uno jar (found in build folder) in your terminal:
 ```bash
 java -jar Uno.jar
 ```

### Join the Game:
Players can join using NetCat:
```bash
nc {server IP} {selected Port Number}
```
At least 2 players must join to start the game.

### The rest is self explanatory!
:D made by Vicente and Tuna, hope you enjoy.

**Disclamer:** <br>
We aren't responsible for any lost friendships, fights, or broken computers. <br>
The game was programmed based on MacOS default terminal colors. <br>
The colors will only work on windows IF you have the terminal app.
